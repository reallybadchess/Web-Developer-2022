  <h1>Ancient Rome</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>In modern <a href="#nowhere">historiography</a>, ancient Rome refers to Roman civilization from the founding of the
    city of Rome in the
    8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. It encompasses the Roman Kingdom
    (753 to 509 BC), Roman Republic (509 to 27 BC) and Roman Empire (27 BC to 476 AD) until the fall of the western
    empire.</p>
  <p>Ancient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, beside the River Tiber in the Italian
    Peninsula. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, and came to control its neighbours through a
    combination of treaties and military strength. It eventually dominated the Italian peninsula, and acquired an Empire
    that took in much of Europe and the lands and peoples surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. It was among the largest
    empires in the ancient world, with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants, roughly 20% of the world's population
    at the time. It covered around 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) at its height in AD 117.</p>
  <h2>Republic</h2>
  <p>According to tradition and later writers such as Livy, the Roman Republic was established around 509 BC,[21] when
    the last of the seven kings of Rome, Tarquin the Proud, was deposed by Lucius Junius Brutus and a system based on
    annually elected magistrates and various representative assemblies was established.[22] A constitution set a series
    of checks and balances, and a separation of powers. The most important magistrates were the two consuls, who
    together exercised executive authority such as imperium, or military command.[23] The consuls had to work with the
    Senate, which was initially an advisory council of the ranking nobility, or patricians, but grew in size and power.

  <h3>Marius and Sulla</h3>
  <p>Gaius Marius, a novus homo, who started his political career with the help of the powerful Metelli family, soon
    become a leader of the Republic, holding the first of his seven consulships (an unprecedented number) in 107 BC by
    arguing that his former patron Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus was not able to defeat and capture the Numidian
    king Jugurtha. Marius then started his military reform: in his recruitment to fight Jugurtha, he levied the very
    poor (an innovation), and many landless men entered the army; this was the seed of securing loyalty of the army to
    the General in command. </p>

  <h3>Caesar and the First Triumvirate</h3>
  <p>In the mid-1st century BC, Roman politics were restless. Political divisions in Rome became identified with two
    groupings, populares (who hoped for the support of the people) and optimates (the "best", who wanted to maintain
    exclusive aristocratic control). Sulla overthrew all populist leaders and his constitutional reforms removed powers
    (such as those of the tribune of the plebs) that had supported populist approaches. Meanwhile, social and economic
    stresses continued to build; Rome had become a metropolis with a super-rich aristocracy, debt-ridden aspirants, and
    a large proletariat often of impoverished farmers. The latter groups supported the Catilinarian conspiracyâ€”a
    resounding failure, since the consul Marcus Tullius Cicero quickly arrested and executed the main leaders of the
    conspiracy.</p>
